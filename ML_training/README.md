# ML_training

This directory contains resources used for training machine learning algorithms.

It is expected that the training data for these will be generated by the scripts in directory `classic_CV` which use a camera to track a feature and save the results and annotations in files.

The output format for this training data will be described in file `lib/data_io/data_format.py`, while classes for saving/loading these files will be found in `lib/data_io/handlers.py`.

The training files generated by the scripts in `classic_CV` should be placed under `ML_training/datasets`.
